## "Data Scientist" is a means to explore my interests in tennis, transportation, and streaming. I want to learn about the entire data pipeline and its product cycle. It is enriching to keep learning skills outside my expertise. I am easily excited by the passion of others, and I am seeking out a experienced startup founder/manager to work with.
