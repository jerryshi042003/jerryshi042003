## "Data Scientist" 
is a means to explore my interests in tennis, transportation, and streaming data. I love side projects and love to work with motivated people. Right now, I'm seeking an environment where I can be around technical mentors.

*I am especially looking for startups in the Bay or New York Area. Please contact me at jerryshi042003@gmail.com*
